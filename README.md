# 🐍 The Big Book of Small Python Projects – My Solutions

This repository contains my personal implementations of the projects from  
📘 *"The Big Book of Small Python Projects: 81 Easy Practice Programs"* by **Al Sweigart**.

Each project is a small standalone Python script designed to improve coding skills, logical thinking, and creativity.  
I’m going through the book step by step — treating each exercise as both a learning opportunity and a fun mini-challenge.
